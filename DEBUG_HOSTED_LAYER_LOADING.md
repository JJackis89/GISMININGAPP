# Debugging: Hosted Layer Data Not Loading in Edit Panel

## Issue Description
The hosted layer's data doesn't load in the edit concession panel.

## Root Cause Analysis
The original implementation was only using `concessionEditingService.getAllConcessions()` which only returned data from localStorage. It wasn't loading the hosted layer data from the ArcGIS service.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Data Loading in ConcessionEdit.tsx
```typescript
const loadConcessions = async () => {
  try {
    setLoading(true)
    
    // First, initialize the mining data service to get hosted layer data
    console.log('üîÑ Loading hosted layer data for editing...')
    await miningDataService.initialize()
    const hostedLayerData = await miningDataService.getMiningConcessions()
    
    console.log(`‚úÖ Loaded ${hostedLayerData.length} concessions from hosted layer`)
    
    // Initialize the editing service with hosted layer data
    concessionEditingService.initialize(hostedLayerData)
    
    // Get all concessions (which now includes hosted layer data + any local edits)
    const allConcessions = await concessionEditingService.getAllConcessions()
    setConcessions(allConcessions)
    
    console.log(`üìù Total concessions available for editing: ${allConcessions.length}`)
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback logic for offline mode
    ...
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced ConcessionEditingService.initialize()
```typescript
initialize(concessions: MiningConcession[]) {
  // Store existing local edits (new concessions or modifications)
  const existingLocalData = Array.from(this.concessions.values())
  const localOnlyIds = new Set<string>()
  
  // Find concessions that exist only locally (new ones created in editing)
  existingLocalData.forEach(existing => {
    const isLocalOnly = !concessions.find(hosted => hosted.id === existing.id)
    if (isLocalOnly) {
      localOnlyIds.add(existing.id)
    }
  })
  
  // Clear and rebuild with hosted layer data
  this.concessions.clear()
  
  // Add all hosted layer concessions
  concessions.forEach(concession => {
    this.concessions.set(concession.id, { ...concession })
  })
  
  // Re-add local-only concessions (newly created ones)
  existingLocalData.forEach(localConcession => {
    if (localOnlyIds.has(localConcession.id)) {
      this.concessions.set(localConcession.id, localConcession)
    }
  })
  
  this.saveToStorage()
  this.notifyListeners()
}
```

### 3. Added UI Improvements
- **Refresh Button**: Allows manual refresh of hosted layer data
- **Data Source Status**: Shows when data was last loaded
- **Debug Component**: Displays data counts from different sources
- **Better Loading Messages**: More descriptive loading states

### 4. Added Error Handling
- Fallback to local data if hosted layer fails
- Console logging for debugging
- Visual error indicators

## Testing Steps

1. **Navigate to Edit Panel**: Go to `/edit` route
2. **Check Debug Info**: Verify hosted layer data count vs editing service count
3. **Verify Data Display**: Confirm all concessions from hosted layer appear in table
4. **Test Refresh**: Click refresh button to reload hosted layer data
5. **Test Editing**: Create/edit concessions to verify local changes persist

## Expected Behavior

- **Initial Load**: Should display all concessions from hosted ArcGIS layer
- **Refresh**: Should reload fresh data from hosted layer while preserving local edits
- **Editing**: Local changes should be preserved and merged with hosted data
- **Data Counts**: Debug panel should show same count for hosted layer and editing service

## Console Output to Monitor

```
üîÑ Loading hosted layer data for editing...
‚úÖ Loaded [N] concessions from hosted layer
üîÑ Editing service initialized with [N] hosted concessions + [M] local concessions
üìù Total concessions available for editing: [Total]
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/pages/ConcessionEdit.tsx**: Updated data loading logic
2. **src/services/concessionEditingService.ts**: Enhanced initialize method
3. **src/components/Debug/DataSourceDebug.tsx**: Added debug component

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with live hosted layer
2. Remove debug component once confirmed working
3. Add more sophisticated merge logic if needed
4. Consider caching strategies for performance

This solution ensures that the editing panel always has access to the latest hosted layer data while preserving any local edits or new concessions created through the editing interface.
