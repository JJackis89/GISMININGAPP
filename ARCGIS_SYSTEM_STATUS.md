# ✅ ARCGIS-BASED SYSTEM STATUS

## Current Configuration ✅

Your EPA Mining Concessions application is **correctly configured** to use **ArcGIS as the primary data source** and is **NOT using PostgreSQL**.

### 📊 **Current Data Flow:**
```
Dashboard → unifiedDataService → miningDataService → ArcGIS Feature Layer
```

### 🔧 **Services Currently Active:**

1. **`unifiedDataService.ts`** ✅
   - **Status**: Active and being used by Dashboard
   - **Purpose**: Main interface for data operations
   - **Backend**: Delegates to ArcGIS miningDataService
   - **Configuration**: ✅ Correctly configured for ArcGIS

2. **`miningDataService.ts`** ✅  
   - **Status**: Active ArcGIS integration
   - **Purpose**: Handles ArcGIS Feature Layer data
   - **Notifications**: ✅ Already calls `generatePermitNotifications()`
   - **Configuration**: ✅ Properly integrated with notification service

3. **`postgresDataService.ts`** ❌
   - **Status**: NOT being used in the application
   - **Purpose**: PostgreSQL integration (unused)
   - **Note**: This service exists but is not imported or used anywhere

### 🎯 **Stale Notifications Issue Resolution:**

For your ArcGIS-based system, the notifications **should already be working correctly** because:

✅ **`miningDataService.ts` already calls:**
```typescript
// Line 198 in miningDataService.ts
notificationService.generatePermitNotifications(this.cachedData)
```

✅ **This happens every time data is fetched from ArcGIS**

✅ **Your Dashboard uses unifiedDataService → miningDataService → ArcGIS**

### 🔍 **Verification Steps:**

1. **Check Console Logs** when you update a concession:
   - Look for: `🚨 NotificationService: Found expired permit:`
   - Look for: `✅ NotificationService: Generated [X] expired permit notifications`

2. **Test Notification Refresh:**
   - Update an expired concession to make it valid
   - Check if notification automatically disappears
   - Check if notification badge count decreases

### 🛠️ **If Notifications Still Stale:**

The issue might be that **ArcGIS data isn't refreshing** after you make changes. If you're updating data outside the app (directly in ArcGIS Online), you need to:

1. **Force data refresh** in your app
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Or add a manual refresh button**

### ✅ **Conclusion:**

- ✅ Your system is correctly using **ArcGIS, not PostgreSQL**
- ✅ Notification service is properly integrated with ArcGIS service
- ✅ No PostgreSQL cleanup needed - it's already not being used
- ✅ The expired permits discrepancy fix we applied earlier should work with your ArcGIS data

**You're on the right track with ArcGIS!** 🎯
