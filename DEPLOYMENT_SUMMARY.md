2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

**Option B: Using Setup Scripts**
```bash
# Windows
./setup-supabase.bat

# Linux/Mac
./setup-supabase.sh
```

### 2. Test Authentication
Once the database schema is applied:
1. Visit your deployed application
2. Try registering a new user
3. Test login functionality
4. Verify role-based access

### 3. Customize User Roles
